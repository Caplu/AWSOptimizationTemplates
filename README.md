# AWSOptimizationTemplates

These templates were adapted from some common scripts we saw large customers using.

Please use the templates as a basis to create something which works for your company. They are not intended to be a final, polished solution, but just to get you started quickly and knock over some of the common problems you might run into such as finding a way to load your detailed billing report into Redshift each day.

There is a how-to here: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ecrawpublic/How+to+-+DBR-rt+Redshift+Tableau+Draft1l.docx

which is a great place to start.

There's also a cloudformation template to get the Redshift cluster set up if you prefer, and also a data pipeline template.

Cheers,
